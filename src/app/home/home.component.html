As a recent graduate of the Front-End Developer Training Program , I am ready to embark on my career in front-end development. During my time at the training institute, I not only learned essential front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, but I also gained valuable hands-on experience through teamwork. My team and I successfully developed a fully functional e-commerce platform. This experience gave me a deep understanding of the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.
